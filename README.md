### [Project Description](doc/Proj1_desc.md)
This is the first and only *individual* (as opposed to *team*) this semester. 

Term: Spring 2019

+ Projec title: Why Makes You Happy?
+ This project is conducted by Zhicheng Zhang(zz2555)

+ Project summary: In this project I conducted a brief study about why people are happy using the data from HappyDB. Basically, this project uses techniques of text mining. The results shows that words like friends, family, game, birthday, and home are most commonly used words when people recall their happy moment. And happiness might be influenced by many factors such as time period, gender, and age.
